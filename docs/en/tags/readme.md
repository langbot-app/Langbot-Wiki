# Service API Overview

LangBot provides a set of APIs for external services to integrate. These APIs are authenticated with API keys, which are a subset of the HTTP API. To view the API documentation for frontend-backend communication, please go to the [Development](/en/develop/dev-config) section.

::: warning
Service API is currently in Beta and some APIs may change frequently.

## Use API

The left sidebar lists all available APIs. You can fill in your instance address (the port address exposed by the backend, default is `http://localhost:5300`) and API Key, then click the `Try it out` button to call the API.
