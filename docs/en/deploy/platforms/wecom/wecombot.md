Click to randomly generate Token and EncodingAESKey, then fill in the basic bot information above. **Pay attention to setting the visibility scope**.

Click `My Company` in the left sidebar and save the Company ID at the bottom.

## Configuring Callback URL

Start the LangBot main program, select the adapter `WeCom Intelligent Bot`, and fill in the configuration items.  
Among them, the token is Token, the Encoding-AESKey is EncodingAESKey, and the Bot ID can be filled in as xxx (or filled in randomly, it will be changed later). After filling in, click  
`Save`, and `Enable` the robot.

Return to the WeCom robot configuration page, and fill in the robot callback URL (accepts HTTP) in `URL`, for example: **http://xxx.xxx.xx.xx:2291/callback/command**. If the creation is successful, it will jump to the details page. If the message `Request URL Failed` appears, please double-check whether the above steps have been completed one by one.
