### Final Steps

Extract the zip you downloaded, navigate to the directory containing Lagrange.OneBot.exe, open a cmd command prompt in this directory, and enter

```bash
.\Lagrange.OneBot
```

Run it once, if a QR code is output, you can directly scan it with the bot account to log in (if the QR code is not clear, you can look for the image file in the lagrange data directory).  

If you cannot log in, please check if you have correctly filled in the signature address SignServerUrl in the lagrange configuration file appsettings.json. Please look for the signature address in the lagrange documentation.
