## Installing the Main Program

1. Go to the [Release](https://github.com/langbot-app/LangBot/releases) page to download the latest version of the zip package (recommended) `langbot-xxx-all.zip` (do not download Source Code as it does not include WebUI). Extract it and open a command line (terminal) in the extracted directory.

2. Install dependencies

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage dependencies.

```bash
pip install uv
uv sync
```

3. Run the main program once to generate configuration files

```bash
uv run main.py
```

You will see the following message:

```
