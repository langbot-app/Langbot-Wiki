3. Select your own agent (or create a new one) from the project development section. The obtained ID is the `bot_id`.

## 2. Entering the Configuration in LangBot

1. Open the LangBot WebUI and navigate to the configuration page of a pipeline (or create a new pipeline and enter its configuration page)

2. Under "AI Capabilities", select the runner as `Coze API`

3. In the runner's configuration items, enter:
   - **token**: Paste the API Token you copied from the Coze platform
   - **bot_id**: Paste the corresponding Bot ID

Once completed, you can invoke the Coze agent within this pipeline for dialogue processing

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Save fails or invocation returns an error**: Please verify that the token and bot_id are correct and do not contain extra spaces
- **Unable to select `Coze API`**: Please confirm whether the current version supports this runner. If not yet supported, please upgrade to a version that includes the Coze runner
