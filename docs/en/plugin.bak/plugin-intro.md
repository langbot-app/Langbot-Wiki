## Plugin Categories

**Plugins** are extension modules for LangBot, containing two types of executable content: **event listeners** and **content functions**. Event listeners are driven by events in the main program, while content functions are driven by content generated by GPT. Both driving methods are uniformly wrapped in the plugin class.

### Event Listeners

Plugins listen to various events during LangBot's operation. When an event occurs, LangBot calls the listener registered by the plugin with event-related information. Plugins can register listeners to be triggered in specific situations.

### Content Functions

Content functions differ from event-triggered plugins in that during a conversation, when the conversation content matches the description of a content function, GPT specifies which function to call, and LangBot makes the call.
This is implemented based on [GPT's Function Calling capability](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling), which is a function embedded in the conversation and automatically called by GPT.

> It's like the official ChatGPT plugins

For example, if we provide GPT with a function `access_the_web` and provide detailed descriptions of it and its parameters, then when we talk to GPT about content similar to the following:

```
Q: Please search for QQ bot projects on GitHub?
Q: Please search for some good cloud service provider websites for me?
Q: Read and summarize this article: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/607570830
Q: Search for the weather in Qingyuan today
```

GPT will respond with a function call request for `access_the_web`, LangBot will call the content function provided by the plugin, and return the call result to GPT for it to generate a new response.  
Of course, the function calling feature is not limited to web access, it can also implement image processing, scientific calculations, trip planning, and other functions that require function calls. Theoretically, we can implement the same functionality as `ChatGPT Plugins` through content functions.
