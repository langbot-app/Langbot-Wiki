# Message Platform Entities

:::info Table of Contents

:::

LangBot supports multiple messaging platforms, and each platform has different `message entity` formats. To abstract away these differences, we have implemented a unified standard. Plugin developers only need to master and use the message entities described on this page in plugins, and LangBot's internal message processing logic can automatically handle message parsing and conversion.

## Message Chain

`Messages` on messaging platforms are different from messages used for AI interaction. Messages on messaging platforms are described in the form of `message chains`. Each independent message displayed on QQ is a message chain, which can contain various `message chain components` such as `text`, `images`, `@mentions`, etc. For example:

![](/assets/image/zh/plugin/dev/apis/plugin_dev_messages_01.png)

This is a message chain containing one Plain component (Hello World) and one Image component (Usagi).

The definitions of message chains and message chain components are located in `langbot_plugin.api.entities.platform.message`.

### Constructing Message Chains

Please first import the `langbot_plugin.api.entities.platform.message` package to use the message components within it.

```python
from langbot_plugin.api.entities.platform.message import *

# Build a message containing text "Hello LangBot" and an image (from URL)
msg_chain = MessageChain([
    Plain(text="Hello LangBot"),
    Image(url='https://qchatgpt.rockchin.top/langbot-logo.png')
])

# Build a message containing @everyone and text "Hello LangBot"
msg_chain = MessageChain([
    AtAll(),
    Plain(text="Hello LangBot")
])

# Build a message containing @specific member and text "Hello LangBot"
msg_chain = MessageChain([
    At(target=123456),
    Plain(text="Hello LangBot")
])
```

Currently supported message chain components:

- `Source` - Source message chain information. Messages received from messaging platforms will include this component at the front of the message chain to record message information
- `Plain` - Plain text message
- `Quote` - Quote message
- `Image` - Image message
- `AtAll` - @everyone message
- `At` - @specific member message
- `Voice` - Voice message
    - Need to check messaging platform support
- `Forward` - Forward message
    - Not supported on many platforms, not recommended
- `File` - File message

When creating components, named parameters must be used. For specific usage, you can check the definitions in the source code `langbot_plugin.api.entities.platform.message`.

## Other Entities

In addition to the above entities, there are also entities like `Friend` and `Group`. These entities are defined in `langbot_plugin.api.entities.platform.entities`.

## Accessing Underlying Platform APIs

:::warning Note
Not applicable for 4.x.
:::

To abstract away platform differences, LangBot provides an abstraction layer above messaging platform APIs, which includes the content described above and various platform adapters in the `pkg/platform/sources` directory.
However, due to significant platform differences, the entity and API encapsulation in the abstraction layer is not complete. If your plugin needs to access platform-specific functionality, you can access underlying APIs according to the following instructions.

:::info
The `adapter` here is the instantiated object of each adapter, corresponding to the `xxxAdapter(adapter.MessagePlatformAdapter)` classes in files under `pkg/platform/sources/`. It can be obtained from `query.adapter` in plugin events, for example:

```python
    # For example in a plugin
    @handler(GroupMessageReceived)
    async def _(self, ctx: EventContext):
        # Get adapter object
        adapter = ctx.query.adapter
```
