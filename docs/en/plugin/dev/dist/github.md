# Distribute Plugins via GitHub

You can upload your plugin to GitHub, create a Release for the repository, and upload the `.lbpkg` file, allowing other users to install it in LangBot.

## Build Plugin

Execute the following command in the plugin directory:

```bash
lbp build
```

This will generate a `.lbpkg` file in the `dist` directory.

## Create Release

Upload your plugin to GitHub, then go to the Release page of your plugin repository, click to create a Release, and upload the `.lbpkg` file you just built.
