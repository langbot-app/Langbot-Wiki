# LangBot Plugins

LangBot is composed of various internal components such as Large Language Model tools, commands, messaging platform adapters, LLM requesters, and more. To meet extensibility and flexibility requirements, we have implemented a production-grade plugin system.

Each plugin runs in an independent process, managed uniformly by the Plugin Runtime.

## Plugin Structure

Plugins can provide the following components based on their specific functionality:

- Event Handlers: Listen to events during pipeline execution and modify context or pipelines.
- Commands: Triggered by user command messages starting with `!` (or other configured prefixes).
- Tools: Called by LLMs during execution of LangBot's built-in Local Agent.

More component types will be supported for plugin implementation in the future.

## Installing Plugins

Currently supports uploading plugin packages and installing plugins from the plugin marketplace.
In LangBot's plugin management page, click the top-right corner to choose the installation method.

Click `Upload Local`, select `.lbpkg` files shared by others or downloaded from the Marketplace to install plugins.

Or click the Plugin Marketplace tab, select a plugin, and click install.

After installing plugins, you need to select the plugin in your pipeline configuration page.
